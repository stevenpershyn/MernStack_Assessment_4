//Assessment #4
//1. Create a class component and show all the life cycle hooks
//2. Make a state change, the state should be duplicate and then stop it to call render method to improve efficiency.
//3. Create a product component using functional component and hooks (try using use state to read default values from reducer)
// 	 Create a form to allow user to submit Product Details - name, price, desc, rating
// 	 Create an action method to add the detail to database using a server api
// 	 Server Side - Create product router and api to save the product using productdatamodel
//4. Create a route and navigation to show product component
//5. Explain various hooks in functional component (at least 5)

//useState: adds state management to functional components.  
//useEffect: performs side effects such as data fetching, DOM Manipulation, or setting up subscriptions. 
//useContext: allows you to access the context value provided by a Context.Provider
//useReducer: allows managing state through a reducer function.
//useRef: allows you to create mutable object references that persist across renders.
